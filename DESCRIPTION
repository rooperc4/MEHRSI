Description: The purpose of this package and its associated functions is to allow the user to 
    compute annual indices of abundance from survey data using a habitat model based on Rooper 
    and Martin (2012). It is designed to be a 2-stage model, with the first stage setting the 
    biological limits for a species (such as depth ranges from 85-250 m for Pacific Ocean perch 
    or geographical limits on Northern rockfish distribution). In the second stage a iterative 
    modeling process fits CPUE data to habitat variables chosen by the user. Individual habitat 
    variables are constrained to using one of 3 shapes for the fitting (dome, asymptotic or 
    linear). Model fitting is completed using the optim function in R and parameters and variables 
    are removed sequentially until there is no improvement in model AIC. Full details of the 
    modeling and the manuscript can be found at https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/spo/FishBull/1101/rooper.pdf 
    and the preceeding papers where the method was developed (Rooper and Martin 2009 -
